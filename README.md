# critical-css-example
This is a basic example to show how I set up my critical CSS and how I use the `postcss-critical-spit` plugin.

## Install
* Clone the repository 
* Open a Terminal window in the main project folder
* run `npm install`

## Usage
* Run `gulp` to generate the files and run a local server with development setup
* Run 'gulp --release' to generate the files and run a local server with release (aka critically-rendered) assets
* Check out the `Gulpfile` and the `main-critical.css` file in the `build/css` folder to see what happens
